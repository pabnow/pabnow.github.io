			<p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Rochester fails to hold police officers accountable for misconduct and brutality. 
			Between 2001 and 2016, citizens filed <span>929 allegations of excessive force</span> against the RPD. 
			The Chief of Police, who has the sole power to discipline officers, <span>only sustained 16</span> of these allegations.
			 This is <span>injustice</span>. 
			 And the reason is obvious: the Chief of Police cannot be expected to investigate, evaluate, and discipline police officers. 
			 This is a <span>clear conflict of interest</span>. 
			 Even in the rare instance that the Chief does discipline an officer, the punishment is inadequate; 
			 Between 2002 and 2016, <span>only 13 officers were disciplined</span>, of those only 6 were suspended, and <span>none were fired</span>. 
			 Police misconduct will continue unless this broken system is replaced with an independent system that serves the interest of the people of Rochester not the RPD.</p>
 
			<p style="text-align: justify;">A coalition of community organizations came together in 2017 and proposed a Police Accountability Board (PAB) to replace the current broken system. 
			The proposed PAB would be a civilian led oversight board that is rooted in <span>five essential pillars</span>:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>an independent agency of city government, separate from RPD, with a budget equivalent to 1% of RPD's</li>
			<li>independent investigative authority</li>
			<li>subpoena power</li>
			<li>disciplinary power through a disciplinary matrix</li>
			<li>power to assess RPD policies and procedures and make recommendations</li>		  
		</ul>
	      <p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of the board members of the PAB would be nominated by a <span>coalition of the Rochester community organizations</span> called the <span>Police Accountability Board Alliance</span>. The Alliance removes the conflict of interest and replaces it with a <span>democratic, civilian-lead oversight system</span>.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Rochester does not hold police officers accountable for misconduct and brutality. Between 2001 and 2016 there were <b>929 allegations of excessive force</b> filed by citizens. The Chief of Police, who has the sole power to discipline officers, <b>only sustained 16</b> of these allegations. The system is broken. And the reason is obvious: the Chief of Police cannot be expected to investigate, evaluate, and discipline police officers. This is a <b>clear conflict of interest.</b> Even if the Chief does choose to sustain complaints against officers, rarely does the punishment amount to anything substantial. Between 2002 and 2016, <b>only 13 officers were disciplined</b>, of those only 6 were suspended, and <b>none were fired.</b> Police misconduct will continue unless this broken system is replaced with an independent system that serves the interest of the citizens of Rochester not the RPD.</p>
		  <p style="text-align: justify;">The Police Accountability Board (PAB) is a civilian led oversight body that is being proposed as a replacement to the current system. The PAB is based off <b>five essential pillars:</b></p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>Independent investigative authority as an agency of city government independent from the RPD;</li>
			<li>Subpoena power to compel the production of evidence and witnesses;</li>
			<li>The authority to conduct misconduct hearings;</li>
			<li>Disciplinary authority; and</li>
			<li>The power to evaluate systemic patterns, practices, policies, and procedures of the RPD to recommend changes and prevent misconduct.</li>
		  </ul>
	      <p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of the members of the PAB would be nominated by a <b>coalition of the Rochester community organizations</b> called the <b>PAB Alliance</b>. The Alliance takes the power out of the hands of the Chief of Police and places it into a <b>democratic, civilian-lead body.</b></p>
